Simple example of the generated service.

It serves 2 protocols: HTTP (REST) and GRPC.
Both are using the same handler for business logic.

Each protocol has corresponding autogenerated client.

Example is able to run 3 binaries:
* server (with a middleware to recover from panics)
* HTTP client
* GRPC client

Everything is generated from [sum.proto](./pb/sum.proto).

## How to run

### Server

```sh
make run-server
```

### HTTP client

```sh
make run-client-http
```

### GRPC client

```sh
make run-client-grpc
```

## Regenerate protobuf

```sh
make build
```

### If you also want to regenerate the implementation

To force rebuild all files during generation, change `force=false` to `force=true` in the Makefile.
